# credit-risk-classification

Purpose: 
The purpose of the analysis is to understand how credible people who borrow money are. In doing so it will allow companys that lend money be able to properly identify people who are less likely to be able to pay back what they borrow and be able to flag them as a risk.

Results:
-The accuracy score was a 99% showing that it is highly reliable at being correct.
-The precision score for healthy loans was 100% meanwhile for the high-risk loans it showed a 87%. Meaning that it is consistent with its predictions.
-The recall score was a 99%, which shows 99% of the precise predictions are accurate.

Summary:
I would highly recommend this model to companys looking for a way to test the creditibilty of borrowers. Across all cateogories of results it showed that it performs exeptionally well at finding true positives consistently.However I believe thats its important that this should be used as a guideline instead of a fact. Its not perfect but it will give them a good assessment of their customers.
